## 🧪 Sample Linux Exercises

Below are **example exercises** that represent the style and scope of the 530-exercise workbook.

### Exercise 1 – Directory Navigation

Create a directory named practice.
Inside it, create three subdirectories: docs, logs, scripts.
Navigate between them using only relative paths.

### Exercise 2 – File Creation and Output

Create a file called notes.txt.
Add at least three lines of text.
Display only the first and last line using command-line tools.

### Exercise 3 – Permissions and Ownership

Create a file named secret.txt.
Remove write permissions for everyone except the owner.
Verify the permissions using ls -l.

### Exercise 4 – Text Searching

Create a text file containing at least 10 lines.
Use grep to find all lines containing the word "error".
Count how many matching lines were found.

### Exercise 5 – Process Inspection

List all running processes.
Identify a process started by your user.
Display its PID and CPU usage.
